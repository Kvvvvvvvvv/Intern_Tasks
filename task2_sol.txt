Attachment: `Invoice_8273.zip` 


Used a fake example for training purposes.

Email looked like it came from PayPal, saying the account was limited.

2. Checked the Sender Email Address

Email shown: support@paypa1.com

Issue found: This is a spoofed domain. It uses the number 1 instead of the letter l to trick the user.

3. Viewed and Analyzed the Email Header

Opened the full email header (simulated through Gmail-style method: "Show Original").

Pasted it into MxToolbox Email Header Analyzer.

Findings:

Return-Path didn't match sender.

Email came from an unknown server, not owned by PayPal.

SPF/DKIM likely failed.

4. Hovered Over Links

Link shown in email: https://paypal.com.secureverify-account.ru

Real domain: secureverify-account.ru (not PayPal)

Used hover (without clicking) to view actual link.

Conclusion: Link is misleading and dangerous.

5. Read the Email Body for Urgent Language

Found lines like: ‚ÄúVerify your identity immediately‚Äù and ‚ÄúYour account will be permanently suspended.‚Äù

This is a scare tactic commonly used in phishing attacks.

6. Checked for Grammar & Personalization

Found grammar issues, awkward sentences.

Email used ‚ÄúDear customer‚Äù instead of a real name ‚Äî a red flag.

7. Attachment Check

No attachments in this email, but learned that .zip, .exe, .xlsm are common phishing file types.

Tools like VirusTotal can be used to scan them.
